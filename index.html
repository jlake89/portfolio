  <p>I’m never sure what to say in these sections, but I’ll give it my best! Hey, I’m Joel! I live in Seattle with my
    partner Terry and our two dogs <span class="dog-names">Sophie and Andy</span>. I grew up in Spokane and graduated from Eastern Washington University (EWU) in Cheney. Below are some of my interests and hobbies, <em>in no particular order:</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Droning</li>
    <li>Dogs</li>
    <li>Cars and Boats</li>
    <li>Food</li>
    <li>Traveling</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>My Background</h3>
  <p>I currently work at a non-profit 501c3 that facilitates research and development at the VA in Seattle, Tacoma and
    Spokane. I work as the Operations Manager, which includes many aspects of IT and IT troubleshooting. I enjoy my
    work, but as with most non-profits, the pay isn’t great, and the amount of responsibility is great. Before my
    current position, I worked for the State Bar Association coordinating and putting on legal education conferences
    throughout Washington state. Problem solving is something I am forced to do daily in my current role. I can’t wait to flex more of my problem solving skills in bootcamp and beyond!</p>

  <h3>Reasons for getting into Coding</h3>
  <p>Here are my main reasons for trying to break into coding:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Remote work freedom!</li>
    <li>I like problem solving</li>
    <li>Huge demand in the job market</li>
    <li>Long term career outlook</li>
    <li>Coding is fun!</li>
  </ol>
