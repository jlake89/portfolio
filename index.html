<h1>Joel Lake's Epicodus Portfolio Page</h1>
<h2>Welcome! I'm glad you stopped by.</h2>
<p>This page is designed to showcase my Epicodus student work.</p>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>What I look like:</p>
<img src="img/JoelHeadshot.jpeg" alt="Headshot of Joel.">

<p>I’m never sure what to say in these sections, but I’ll give it my best! Hey, I’m Joel! I live in Seattle with my partner Terry and our two dogs Sophie and Andy. I grew up in Spokane and went to college at Eastern Washington University (EWU) in Cheney. Below are some of my interests and hobbies, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Droning</li>
  <li>Dogs</li>
  <li>Cars and Boats</li>
  <li>Food</li>
  <li>Traveling</li>
</ul>

<h3>My Background</h3>
<p>I currently work at a non-profit 501c3 that facilitates research and development at the VA in Seattle, Tacoma and Spokane. I work as the Operations Manager, which includes many aspects of IT and IT troubleshooting. I enjoy my work, but as with most non-profits, the pay isn’t great, and the amount of responsibility is large. Before my current position, I worked for the State Bar Association coordinating and putting on legal education conferences throughout Washington state. </p>
